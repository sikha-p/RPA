# Utility to Trace Packages and Commands Usage Across A360 TaskBots


This repository provides a utility for tracing Packages and Commands Usage Across A360 TaskBots within a specified folder. Follow the steps below to utilize this Utility effectively.

## Steps to Follow

1. **IMPORT THE BOT UTILITY TO YOUR CONTROL ROOM**
   - Download the exported copy of the utility (Its an A360 Bot - `Export.TracePackagesnCommands.sikha_creator.zip`) into your control room.
   - You can find the Utility bot and dependent files in "**TracePackagesnCommandsUtility**" folder
   - - This utility consists of :
       - **TracePackagesnCommandsBot** â€“ Responsible for generating a report based on input data.
       - and a dependent Python script file as well.

2. **MODIFY THE INPUT FILE**
   - Download the **Input.xlsx** file from this repository. 
   - Open the `Input.xlsx` file and navigate to the "Inputs" sheet.
   - Fill in the required Packages and Commands.
   - You should keep this updated Input.xlsx file in the InputOutputFolder specified while running the Bots.
   - If you're only interested in knowing which automations use certain packages:
Just include a single column in your input sheet named "Package Name". This will help the utility scan and report all automations that reference those packages.

   - If you want to find out only some specific commands within those packages are being used:
Then your input sheet needs two columns:

One for "Package Name"
Another for "Command Name"
This allows the utility to trace command-level usage across automations.

   - To obtain the Command name, Package name, Attribute name, and Attribute value:
     1. Create a new bot and drag and drop the command listed in the "BulkBotCommandUpdater" input Excel file.
     2. Fill in the required details with placeholder data.
     3. Inspect the page by pressing `F12` and navigate to the Network tab.
     4. Search for the API endpoint:
        ```
        <CR_URL>/v2/repository/files/<Bot_id>/content?hasErrors=false
        ```
     5. Check the request payload and the `nodes` object; you will find the command name, package name, and attribute name there.

   - This will add two additional sheets to the `Input.xlsx` file: "Bot_IDs" and "Pre-update-report".
   - 

 

6. **RUN THE BULKBOTCOMMANDUPDATER BOT**
   - Next, run the `BulkBotCommandsUpdater_V2` bot to update the commands and attributes within the bots.

7. **REVIEW THE UPDATE STATUS**
   - The bot will update the commands with the specified attribute values and create a `Post_update_report` sheet for you to review the update status.
   - A log file will be generated in the `inputOutputFolder`, named `bulkbotcommandupdater.log`.

## Note

Please make sure that the best practices are followed, and changes are done on development server before promoting to the production environment.
