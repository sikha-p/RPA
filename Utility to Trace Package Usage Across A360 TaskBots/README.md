# Utility to Trace Packages and Commands Usage Across A360 TaskBots


This repository provides a utility for tracing Packages and Commands Usage Across A360 TaskBots within a specified folder. Follow the steps below to utilize this Utility effectively.

## Steps to Follow

1. **IMPORT THE BOT UTILITY TO YOUR CONTROL ROOM**
   - Download the exported copy of the utility (Its an A360 Bot - `Export.TracePackagesnCommands.sikha_creator.zip`) into your control room.
   - You can find the Utility bot and dependent files in "**TracePackagesnCommands**" folder
   - - This utility consists of :
       - **TracePackagesnCommands** task bot â€“ Responsible for generating a report based on input data.
       - and a dependent Python script file  **TracePackagesnCommandsScript.py** as well.

2. **MODIFY THE INPUT FILE**
   - Download the **input.xlsx** file from this repository. 
   - Open the `input.xlsx` file and navigate to the "Inputs" sheet.
   - Fill in the required Packages and Commands.
   - You should keep this updated Input.xlsx file in the InputOutputFolder specified while running the Bots.
   - If you're only interested in knowing **which automations use certain packages**:
      - Just include a single column in your input sheet named **"Package Name"**. This will help the utility scan and report all automations that reference those packages.

   - If you want to find out **only some specific commands within those packages** are being used:
        - Then your input sheet needs two columns:
             - One for **"Package Name"**
             - Another for **"Command Name"**
             - <img width="300" height="125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b4b8472-8750-4d40-9983-038339d60e33" />

        - This allows the utility to trace command-level usage across automations.
    
          
 

4. **RETRIEVE COMMAND INFORMATION**
   - To obtain the Command name, Package name, Attribute name, and Attribute value:
     1. Create a new bot and drag and drop the command listed in the input Excel file.
     2. Fill in the required details with placeholder data.
     3. Inspect the page by pressing `F12` and navigate to the Network tab.
     4. Search for the API endpoint:
        ```
        <CR_URL>/v2/repository/files/<Bot_id>/content?hasErrors=false
        ```
     5. Check the request payload and the `nodes` object; you will find the command name, package name there. Use it as per your requirement in the input.xlsx file
